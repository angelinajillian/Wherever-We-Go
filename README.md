During this project for the UC Davis Hackathon 2022, I spearheaded the creation of an online forum aimed at empowering students with disabilities to voice their perspectives and drive change. This platform was not only a technical challenge but also held immense potential for societal impact. Crucially, the success of this endeavor was rooted in the seamless collaboration with a cross-functional team. We harnessed Figma as a collaborative canvas, where abstract ideas seamlessly transformed into palpable design concepts. Subsequently, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to translate these designs into a functional website, uniting aesthetics and functionality.

Collaboration extended to the development phase as well. Teaming up with a skilled peer programmer, we translated the intricate designs into a dynamic reality. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we recreated the envisioned user experience. This phase demanded a blend of technical expertise and an understanding of user behavior. Our collaboration culminated in an accessible and intuitive platform, aligning perfectly with the project's goals of inclusivity and empowerment.

Perhaps the most exhilarating aspect of this journey was our participation in a 24-hour Hackathon. This experience immersed us in a fast-paced and high-pressure environment that demanded rapid adaptation and unwavering focus. Navigating through the intense time constraints, our team not only delivered a functional product but also showcased resilience, innovative thinking, and the ability to thrive in demanding scenarios. This project underscored my ability to excel as part of a multidisciplinary team and to embrace challenges head-on, ultimately solidifying my commitment to impactful software engineering.
